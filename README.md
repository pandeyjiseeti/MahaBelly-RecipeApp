You don’t have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces, just good food from fresh ingredients. Needless to say, we love eating good food the most and we all know there is no better reward for hard work than having an appetizing meal. Don't waste your precious time in determining what to eat and subsequently accumulate ingredients. By MAHABELLY app you can get recipes in a blink of an eye and that too effortlessly.

# 1) PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Tired of eating the same food. Can’t order meals from restaurants. We go to cooking websites to learn new recipes. We don’t have all the ingredients at our home. Collecting all ingredients increases preparation time. And also increases the overall cost of food.
